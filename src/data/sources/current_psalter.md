# Psalm 1

### {Refrain} {def-u: God } knows the way of the righteous.

{1}Blessed are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked, ⁕
   nor lingered in the way of sinners, \
     nor sat in the assembly of the scornful.
{2}Their delight is in the law of {def-l: God } ⁕
   and they meditate on {pn-p-l: God’s } law day and night.
{3}Like a tree planted by streams of water bearing fruit in its season, \
     with leaves that do not wither, ⁕
   whatever they do, it shall prosper.
{4}As for the wicked, it is not so with them; ⁕
   they are like chaff which the wind blows away.
{5}Therefore the wicked shall not be able to stand in the judgement, ⁕
   nor the sinner in the congregation of the righteous.
{6}For {def-l: God } knows the way of the righteous, ⁕
   but the way of the wicked shall perish.

***

# Psalm 2

### {Refrain} {def-u: God } is the strength of {pn-p-l: God’s } people, \
   a safe refuge for {pn-p-l: God’s } anointed.

{1}Why are the nations in tumult, ⁕
   and why do the peoples devise a vain plot?
{2}The rulers of the earth rise up \
     and take counsel together, ⁕
   against {def-l: God } and against {pn-p-l: God’s } anointed:
{3}‘Let us break their bonds asunder ⁕
   and cast away their cords from us.’ 
{4}The one who dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn; ⁕
   {def-l: God } shall have them in derision.
{5}Then shall {pn-s-l: God } speak to them in {pn-p-l: God’s } wrath ⁕
   and terrify them in {pn-p-l: God’s } fury:
{6}‘Yet have I set my {kg-1: King } ⁕
   upon my holy hill of Zion.’ 
{7}I will proclaim the decree of {def-l: God }; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } said to me: ‘You are my {kg-2: Son }; this day have I begotten you.
{8}‘Ask of me and I will give you the nations for your inheritance ⁕
   and the ends of the earth for your possession.
{9}‘You shall break them with a rod of iron ⁕
   and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ 
{10}Now therefore be wise, O rulers; ⁕
   be prudent, you judges of the earth.
{11}Serve {def-l: God } with fear, and with trembling kiss {pn-p-l: God’s } feet, ⁕
   lest {pn-s-l: God } be angry and you perish from the way, \
     for {pn-p-l: God’s } wrath is quickly kindled.
{12}Happy are all they ⁕
   who take refuge in {pn-o-l: God }.

***

# Psalm 3

### {Refrain} You, {voc: God }, are a shield about me.

{1}{voc: God }, how many are my adversaries; ⁕
   many are they who rise up against me.
{2}Many are they who say to my soul, ⁕
   ‘There is no help for you in your God.’ 
{3}But you, {voc: God }, are a shield about me; ⁕
   you are my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
{4}When I cry aloud to {def-l: God }, ⁕
   you will answer me from your holy hill;
{5}I lie down and sleep and rise again, ⁕
   because {def-l: God } sustains me.
{6}I will not be afraid of hordes of the peoples ⁕
   that have set themselves against me all around. 
{7}Rise up, O {voc: God }, and deliver me, O my God, ⁕
   for you strike all my enemies on the cheek \
     and break the teeth of the wicked.
{8}Salvation belongs to {def-l: God }: ⁕
   may your blessing be upon your people.

***

# Psalm 4

### {Refrain} In peace I will lie down and sleep.

{1}Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; ⁕
   you set me at liberty when I was in trouble; \
     have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
{2}How long will you people dishonour my glory; ⁕
   how long will you love vain things and seek after falsehood?
{3}But know that {def-l: God } has shown me {pn-p-l: God’s } marvellous kindness; ⁕
   when I call upon {def-l: God }, {pn-s-l: God } will hear me.
{4}Stand in awe, and sin not; ⁕
   commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. 
{5}Offer the sacrifices of righteousness ⁕
   and put your trust in {def-l: God }.
{6}There are many that say, ‘Who will show us any good?’ ⁕
   {voc: God }, lift up the light of your countenance upon us.
{7}You have put gladness in my heart, ⁕
   more than when their corn and wine and oil increase.
{8}In peace I will lie down and sleep, ⁕
   for it is you {voc: God }, only, who make me dwell in safety.

***

# Psalm 5

### {Refrain} You, O {voc: God }, will bless the righteous.

{1}Give ear to my words, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   consider my lamentation.
{2}Hearken to the voice of my crying, my Ruler and my God, ⁕
   for to you I make my prayer.
{3}In the morning, {voc: God }, you will hear my voice; ⁕
   early in the morning I make my appeal to you, and look up.
{4}For you are the God who takes no pleasure in wickedness; ⁕
   no evil can dwell with you. 
{5}The boastful cannot stand in your sight; ⁕
   you hate all those that work wickedness.
{6}You destroy those who speak lies; ⁕
   the bloodthirsty and deceitful {def-l: God } will abhor.
{7}But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy, \
     I will come into your house; ⁕
   I will bow down towards your holy temple in awe of you. 
{8}Lead me, {voc: God }, in your righteousness, \
     because of my enemies; ⁕
   make your way straight before my face.
{9}For there is no truth in their mouth, \
     in their heart is destruction, ⁕
   their throat is an open sepulchre, \
     and they flatter with their tongue.
{10}Punish them, O God; ⁕
   let them fall through their own devices.
{11}Because of their many transgressions cast them out, ⁕
   for they have rebelled against you. 
{12}But let all who take refuge in you be glad; ⁕
   let them sing out their joy for ever.
{13}You will shelter them, ⁕
   so that those who love your name may exult in you.
{14}For you, O {voc: God }, will bless the righteous; ⁕
   and with your favour you will defend them as with a shield.

***

# Psalm 6

### {Refrain} Turn again, O {voc: God }, and deliver my soul.

{1}O {voc: God }, rebuke me not in your wrath; ⁕
   neither chasten me in your fierce anger.
{2}Have mercy on me, {voc: God }, for I am weak; ⁕
   {voc: God }, heal me, for my bones are racked.
{3}My soul also shakes with terror; ⁕
   how long, O {voc: God }, how long?
{4}Turn again, O {voc: God }, and deliver my soul; ⁕
   save me for your loving mercy’s sake.
{5}For in death no one remembers you; ⁕
   and who can give you thanks in the grave?
{6}I am weary with my groaning; ⁕
   every night I drench my pillow \
     and flood my bed with my tears.
{7}My eyes are wasted with grief ⁕
   and worn away because of all my enemies. 
{8}Depart from me, all you that do evil, ⁕
   for {def-l: God } has heard the voice of my weeping.
{9}{def-u: God } has heard my supplication; ⁕
   {def-l: God } will receive my prayer.
{10}All my enemies shall be put to shame and confusion; ⁕
   they shall suddenly turn back in their shame.

***

# Psalm 7

### {Refrain} Give judgement for me \
   according to my righteousness, O {voc: God }.

{1}O {voc: God } my God, in you I take refuge; ⁕
   save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me,
{2}Lest they rend me like a lion and tear me in pieces ⁕
   while there is no one to help me.
{3}O {voc: God } my God, if I have done these things: ⁕
   if there is any wickedness in my hands,
{4}If I have repaid my friend with evil, ⁕
   or plundered my enemy without a cause,
{5}Then let my enemy pursue me and overtake me, ⁕
   trample my life to the ground, \
     and lay my honour in the dust. 
{6}Rise up, O {voc: God }, in your wrath; \
     lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies. ⁕
   Awaken, my God, the judgement that you have commanded.
{7}Let the assembly of the peoples gather round you; ⁕
   be seated high above them: O {voc: God }, judge the nations.
{8}Give judgement for me according to my righteousness, O {voc: God }, ⁕
   and according to the innocence that is in me.
{9}Let the malice of the wicked come to an end, \
     but establish the righteous; ⁕
   for you test the mind and heart, O righteous God. 
{10}You are my shield that is over me; ⁕
   you save the true of heart.
{11}You are a righteous judge; ⁕
   you are provoked all day long.
{12}If they will not repent, you will whet your sword; ⁕
   you have bent your bow and made it ready.
{13}You have prepared the weapons of death; ⁕
   you make your arrows shafts of fire. 
{14}Behold those who are in labour with wickedness, ⁕
   who conceive evil and give birth to lies.
{15}They dig a pit and make it deep ⁕
   and fall into the hole that they have made for others.
{16}Their mischief rebounds on their own head; ⁕
   their violence falls on their own scalp.
{17}I will give thanks to {def-l: God } for {pn-p-l: God’s } righteousness, ⁕
   and I will make music to the name of {def-l: God } Most High.

# Psalm 8

{1}O {voc: God } our governor, ⁕
   how glorious is your name in all the world!
{2}Your majesty above the heavens is praised ⁕
   out of the mouths of babes at the breast.
{3}You have founded a stronghold against your foes, ⁕
   that you might still the enemy and the avenger.
{4}When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, ⁕
   the moon and the stars that you have ordained,
{5}What are mortals, that you should be mindful of them; ⁕
   mere human beings, that you should seek them out?
{6}You have made them little lower than the angels ⁕
   and crown them with glory and honour.
{7}You have given them dominion over the works of your hands ⁕
   and put all things under their feet,
{8}All sheep and oxen, ⁕
   even the wild beasts of the field,
{9}The birds of the air, the fish of the sea ⁕
   and whatsoever moves in the paths of the sea.
{10}O {voc: God } our governor, ⁕
   how glorious is your name in all the world!

# Psalm 9

### {Refrain} You, {voc: God }, have never failed those who seek you.

{1}I will give thanks to you, {voc: God }, with my whole heart; ⁕
   I will tell of all your marvellous works.
{2}I will be glad and rejoice in you; ⁕
   I will make music to your name, O Most High.
{3}When my enemies are driven back, ⁕
   they stumble and perish at your presence.
{4}For you have maintained my right and my cause; ⁕
   you sat on your throne giving righteous judgement. 
{5}You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; ⁕
   you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
{6}The enemy was utterly laid waste. ⁕
   You uprooted their cities; \
     their very memory has perished.
{7}But {def-l: God } shall endure for ever; ⁕
   you have made fast your throne for judgement.
{8}For you shall rule the world with righteousness ⁕
   and govern the peoples with equity.
{9}Then will {def-l: God } be a refuge for the oppressed, ⁕
   a refuge in the time of trouble.
{10}And those who know your name will put their trust in you, ⁕
   for you, {voc: God }, have never failed those who seek you. 
{11}Sing praises to {def-l: God } who dwells in Zion; ⁕
   declare among the peoples the things {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-has: has } done.
{12}The avenger of blood has remembered them; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } did not forget the cry of the oppressed.
{13}Have mercy upon me, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   consider the trouble I suffer from those who hate me, \
     you that lift me up from the gates of death;
{14}That I may tell all your praises in the gates of the city of Zion ⁕
   and rejoice in your salvation.
{15}The nations shall sink into the pit of their making ⁕
   and in the snare which they set will their own foot be taken.
{16}O {voc: God }, you make yourself known by your acts of justice; ⁕
   the wicked are snared in the works of their own hands. 
{17}They shall return to the land of darkness, ⁕
   all the nations that forget you.
{18}For the needy shall not always be forgotten ⁕
   and the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.
{19}Arise, O {voc: God }, and let not mortals have the upper hand; ⁕
   let the nations be judged before your face.
{20}Put them in fear, O {voc: God }, ⁕
   that the nations may know themselves to be but mortal.

***

# Psalm 10

### {Refrain} You, {voc: God }, have never failed those who seek you.

{1}Why stand so far off, O {voc: God }? ⁕
   Why hide yourself in time of trouble?
{2}The wicked in their pride persecute the poor; ⁕
   let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
{3}The wicked boast of their heart’s desire; ⁕
   the covetous curse and revile {def-l: God }.
{4}The wicked in their arrogance say, ‘God will not avenge it’; ⁕
   in all their scheming God counts for nothing. 
{5}They are stubborn in all their ways \
     for your judgements are far above out of their sight; ⁕
   they scoff at all their adversaries.
{6}They say in their heart, ‘I shall not be shaken; ⁕
   no harm shall ever happen to me.’
{7}Their mouth is full of cursing, deceit and fraud; ⁕
   under their tongue lie mischief and wrong.
{8}They lurk in the outskirts \
     and in dark alleys they murder the innocent; ⁕
   their eyes are ever watching for the helpless.
{9}They lie in wait, like a lion in its den; \
     they lie in wait to seize the poor; ⁕
   they seize the poor when they get them into their net.
{10}The innocent are broken and humbled before them; ⁕
   the helpless fall before their power.
{11}They say in their heart, ‘God has forgotten; ⁕
   {pn-p-l: God’s } face is hidden; {pn-s-l: God } will never see it.’ 
{12}Arise, O {voc: God } God, and lift up your hand; ⁕
   forget not the poor.
{13}Why should the wicked be scornful of God? ⁕
   Why should they say in their hearts, ‘You will not avenge it’?
{14}Surely, you behold trouble and misery; ⁕
   you see it and take it into your own hand.
{15}The helpless commit themselves to you, ⁕
   for you are the helper of the orphan.
{16}Break the power of the wicked and malicious; ⁕
   search out their wickedness until you find none. 
{17}{voc: God }, you shall reign for ever and ever; ⁕
   the nations shall perish from you land.
{18}You will hear the desire of the poor; ⁕
   you will incline your ear to the fullness of their heart,
{19}To give justice to the orphan and oppressed, ⁕
   so that people are no longer driven in terror from the land.

# Psalm 11

### {Refrain} {def-u: God }’s throne is in heaven.

{1}In {def-l: God } have I taken refuge; ⁕
   how then can you say to me, \
     ‘Flee like a bird to the hills,
{2}‘For see how the wicked bend the bow \
     and fit their arrows to the string, ⁕
   to shoot from the shadows at the true of heart.
{3}‘When the foundations are destroyed, ⁕
   what can the righteous do?’ 
{4}{def-u: God } is in {pn-p-l: God’s } holy temple; ⁕
   {def-l: God }’s throne is in heaven.

   {pn-p-l: God’s } eyelids try every mortal being.
{6}{def-u: God } tries the righteous as well as the wicked, ⁕
   but those who delight in violence {pn-p-l: God’s } soul abhors.
{7}Upon the wicked {pn-s-l: God } shall rain coals of fire \
     and burning sulphur; ⁕
   scorching wind shall be their portion to drink.
{8}For {def-l: God } is righteous; \

# Psalm 12

### {Refrain} You, O {voc: God }, will watch over us.

{1}Help me, {voc: God }, for no one godly is left; ⁕
   the faithful have vanished from the whole human race.
{2}They all speak falsely with their neighbour; ⁕
   they flatter with their lips, but speak from a double heart.
{3}O that {def-l: God } would cut off all flattering lips ⁕
   and the tongue that speaks proud boasts!
{4}Those who say, ‘With our tongue will we prevail; ⁕
   our lips we will use; who rules over us?’ 
{5}‘Because of the oppression of the needy, \
     and the groaning of the poor, ⁕
   I will rise up now,’ says {def-l: God }, \
     ‘and set them in the safety that they long for.’
{6}The words of {def-l: God } are pure words, ⁕
   like silver refined in the furnace \
     and purified seven times in the fire.
{7}You, O {voc: God }, will watch over us ⁕
   and guard us from this generation for ever.

   How long will you hide your face from me?
{2}How long shall I have anguish in my soul \
     and grief in my heart, day after day? ⁕
   How long shall my enemy triumph over me? 
{3}Look upon me and answer, O {voc: God } my God; ⁕
   lighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
{4}Lest my enemy say, ‘I have prevailed against them,’ ⁕
   and my foes rejoice that I have fallen. 
{5}But I put my trust in your steadfast love; ⁕
   my heart will rejoice in your salvation.
{6}I will sing to {def-l: God }, ⁕
   who has dealt so bountifully with me.

# Psalm 14

### {Refrain} The fear of {def-l: God } is the beginning of wisdom.

{1}Fools have said in their hearts, ‘There is no God.’ ⁕
   Corrupt are they, and abominable in their wickedness; \
     there is no one that does good.
{2}{def-u: God } has looked down from heaven upon the children of earth, ⁕
   to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks after God.
{3}But every one has turned back; \
     all alike have become corrupt: ⁕
   there is none that does good; no, not one. 
{4}Have they no knowledge, those evildoers, ⁕
   who eat up my people as if they ate bread \
     and do not call upon {def-l: God }?
{5}There shall they be in great fear; ⁕
   for God is in the company of the righteous.
{6}Though they would confound the counsel of the poor, ⁕
   yet {def-l: God } shall be their refuge.
{7}O that Israel’s salvation would come out of Zion! ⁕
   When {def-l: God } restores the fortunes of {pn-p-l: God’s } people, \
     then will Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.

# Psalm 16

### {Refrain} {def-u: God } is at my right hand; I shall not fall.

{1}Preserve me, O God, for in you have I taken refuge; ⁕
   I have said to {def-l: God }, ‘You are my keeper, \
     all my good depends on you.’
{2}All my delight is upon the godly that are in the land, ⁕
   upon those who are noble in heart.

   you are at my right hand; I shall not fall.
{8}Wherefore my heart is glad and my spirit rejoices; ⁕
   my flesh also shall rest secure.
{9}For you will not abandon my soul to Death, ⁕

   and in your right hand are pleasures for evermore.

{2}Let my vindication come forth from your presence; ⁕
   let your eyes behold what is right.
{3}Weigh my heart, examine me by night, ⁕
   refine me, and you will find no impurity in me.

{5}My footsteps hold fast in the ways of your commandments; ⁕
   my feet have not stumbled in your paths.

{7}Show me your marvellous loving-kindness, ⁕
   O Saviour of those who take refuge at your right hand from those who rise up against them.
{8}Keep me as the apple of your eye; ⁕
   hide me under the shadow of your wings,
{9}From the wicked who assault me, ⁕
   from my enemies who surround me to take away my life. 
{10}They have closed their heart to pity ⁕
   and their mouth speaks proud things.
{11}They press me hard, they surround me on every side, ⁕
   watching how they may cast me to the ground,
{12}Like a lion that is greedy for its prey, ⁕
   like a young lion lurking in secret places. 
{13}Arise, {voc: God }; confront them and cast them down; ⁕
   deliver me from the wicked by your sword.
{14}Deliver me, O {voc: God }, by your hand ⁕
   from those whose portion in life is unending,
{15}Whose bellies you fill with your treasure, ⁕
   who are well supplied with children \
     and leave their wealth to their little ones.
{16}As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness; ⁕
   when I awake and behold your likeness, I shall be satisfied.

   {def-u: God } is my crag, my fortress and my deliverer,
{2}My God, my rock in whom I take refuge, ⁕
   my shield, the horn of my salvation and my stronghold.
{3}I cried to {def-l: God } in my anguish ⁕

{5}The cords of the Pit fastened about me ⁕
   and the snares of death entangled me.
{6}In my distress I called upon {def-l: God } ⁕
   and cried out to my God for help.
{7}You heard my voice in your temple ⁕
   and my cry came to your ears. 
{8}The earth trembled and quaked; ⁕
   the foundations of the mountains shook; \
     they reeled because you were angry.
{9}Smoke rose from your nostrils \
     and a consuming fire went out of your mouth; ⁕
   burning coals blazed forth from you.
{10}You parted the heavens and came down ⁕
   and thick darkness was under your feet.
{11}You rode upon the cherubim and flew; ⁕
   you came flying on the wings of the wind.
{12}You made darkness your covering round about you, ⁕
   dark waters and thick clouds your pavilion. 
{13}From the brightness of your presence, through the clouds ⁕
   burst hailstones and coals of fire.
{14}{voc: God }, you also thundered out of heaven; ⁕
   O Most High, you uttered your voice with hailstones and coals of fire.
{15}You sent out your arrows and scattered them; ⁕
   you hurled down lightnings and put them to flight.
{16}The springs of the ocean were seen, \
     and the foundations of the world uncovered ⁕
   at your rebuke, O {voc: God }, \
     at the blast of the breath of your displeasure. 
{17}You reached down from on high and took me; ⁕
   you drew me out of the mighty waters.
{18}You delivered me from my strong enemy, ⁕
   from foes that were too mighty for me.
{19}They came upon me in the day of my trouble; ⁕
   but {def-l: God } was my upholder.
{20}You brought me out into a place of liberty; ⁕
   you rescued me because you delighted in me. 
{21}You rewarded me, {voc: God }, after my righteous dealing; ⁕
   according to the cleanness of my hands you recompensed me,
{22}Because I had kept the ways of {def-l: God } ⁕
   and had not gone wickedly away from my God,
{23}For I had an eye to all your laws, ⁕
   and did not cast out your commandments from me.
{24}I was also wholehearted before you ⁕
   and kept myself from iniquity;
{25}Therefore {def-l: God } rewarded me after my righteous dealing, ⁕
   and according to the cleanness of my hands in your sight. 
{26}With the faithful you show yourself faithful; ⁕
   with the true you show yourself true;
{27}With the pure you show yourself pure, ⁕
   but with the crooked you show yourself perverse.
{28}For you will save a lowly people ⁕
   and bring down the high looks of the proud.
{29}You also shall light my candle; ⁕
   {def-l: God } my God shall make my darkness to be bright.
{30}By your help I shall run at an enemy host; ⁕
   with the help of my God I can leap over a wall. 
{31}As for you, O God, your way is perfect; \
     the word of {def-l: God } is tried in the fire; ⁕
   you are a shield to all who trust in you.
{32}For who is God but {def-l: God }, ⁕
   and who is the rock except our God?
{33}It is you who gird me about with strength ⁕
   and make my way perfect.
{34}You make my feet like hinds’ feet ⁕
   so that I tread surely on the heights.
{35}You teach my hands to fight ⁕
   and my arms to bend a bow of bronze. 
{36}You have given me the shield of your salvation; ⁕
   your right hand upholds me \
     and your grace has made me great.
{37}You enlarge my strides beneath me, ⁕
   yet my feet do not slide.
{38}I will pursue my enemies and overtake them, ⁕
   nor turn again until I have destroyed them.
{39}I will smite them down so they cannot rise; ⁕
   they shall fall beneath my feet.
{40}You have girded me with strength for the battle; ⁕
   you will cast down my enemies under me;
{41}You will make my foes turn their backs upon me ⁕
   and I shall destroy them that hate me. 
{42}They will cry out, but there shall be none to help them; ⁕
   they will cry to {def-l: God }, but you will not answer.
{43}I shall beat them as small as the dust on the wind; ⁕
   I will cast them out as the mire in the streets.
{44}You will deliver me from the strife of the peoples; ⁕
   you will make me the head of the nations.
{45}A people I have not known shall serve me; \
     as soon as they hear me, they shall obey me; ⁕
   strangers will humble themselves before me.
{46}The foreign peoples will lose heart ⁕
   and come trembling out of their strongholds. 
{47}{def-u: God } lives, and blessed be my rock! ⁕
   Praised be the God of my salvation,
{48}Even the God who vindicates me ⁕
   and subdues the peoples under me!
{49}You that deliver me from my enemies, \
     you will set me up above my foes; ⁕
   from the violent you will deliver me;
{50}Therefore will I give you thanks, O {voc: God }, among the nations ⁕
   and sing praises to your name,
{51}To the one who gives great victory to {pn-p-l: God’s } King ⁕
   and shows faithful love to {pn-p-l: God’s } anointed, \
     to David and his descendants for ever.

# Psalm 19

### {Refrain} The commandment of {def-l: God } is pure \
   and gives light to the eyes.

{1}The heavens are telling the glory of God ⁕
   and the firmament proclaims your handiwork.
{2}One day pours out its song to another ⁕
   and one night unfolds knowledge to another.
{3}They have neither speech nor language ⁕
   and their voices are not heard,
{4}Yet their sound has gone out into all lands ⁕
   and their words to the ends of the world.
{5}In them have you set a tabernacle for the sun, ⁕
   that comes forth as a newlywed out of a chamber \
     and rejoices as a champion to run their course.
{6}It goes forth from the end of the heavens \
     and runs to the very end again, ⁕
   and there is nothing hidden from its heat. 
{7}The law of {def-l: God } is perfect, reviving the soul; ⁕
   the testimony of {def-l: God } is sure \
     and gives wisdom to the simple.
{8}The statutes of {def-l: God } are right and rejoice the heart; ⁕
   the commandment of {def-l: God } is pure \
     and gives light to the eyes.
{9}The fear of {def-l: God } is clean and endures for ever; ⁕
   the judgements of {def-l: God } are true \
     and righteous altogether.
{10}More to be desired are they than gold, \
     more than much fine gold, ⁕
   sweeter also than honey, \
     dripping from the honeycomb.
{11}By them also is your servant taught ⁕
   and in keeping them there is great reward. 
{12}Who can tell how often they offend ⁕
   O cleanse me from my secret faults!
{13}Keep your servant also from presumptuous sins lest they get dominion over me; ⁕
   so shall I be undefiled, \
     and innocent of great offence.
{14}Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, ⁕
   O {voc: God }, my strength and my redeemer.

   and strengthen you out of Zion;
{3}Remember all your offerings ⁕
   and accept your burnt sacrifice;
{4}Grant you your heart’s desire ⁕

{7}Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, ⁕
   but we will call only on the name of {def-l: God } our God.
{8}They are brought down and fallen, ⁕
   but we are risen and stand upright.
{9}O {voc: God }, save the King ⁕
   and answer us when we call upon you.

# Psalm 21

### {Refrain} The King puts his trust in {def-l: God }.

{1}The King shall rejoice in your strength, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   how greatly shall he rejoice in your salvation!
{2}You have given him his heart’s desire ⁕
   and have not denied the request of his lips.
{3}For you come to meet him with blessings of goodness ⁕
   and set a crown of pure gold upon his head.
{4}He asked of you life and you gave it him, ⁕
   length of days, for ever and ever. 
{5}His honour is great because of your salvation; ⁕
   glory and majesty have you laid upon him.
{6}You have granted him everlasting felicity ⁕
   and will make him glad with joy in your presence.
{7}For the King puts his trust in {def-l: God }; ⁕
   because of the loving-kindness of the Most High, \
     he shall not be overthrown. 
{8}Your hand shall mark down all your enemies; ⁕
   your right hand will find out those who hate you.
{9}You will make them like a fiery oven in the time of your wrath; ⁕
   {def-l: God } will swallow them up in anger \
     and the fire will consume them.
{10}Their fruit you will root out of the land ⁕
   and their descendants from among its inhabitants. 
{11}Because they intend evil against you ⁕
   and devise wicked schemes which they cannot perform,
{12}You will put them to flight ⁕
   when you aim your bow at their faces.
{13}Be exalted, O {voc: God }, in your own might; ⁕
   we will make music and sing of your power.

### {Refrain} Be not far from me, O {voc: God }.

{1}My God, my God, why have you forsaken me, ⁕
   and are so far from my salvation, \
     from the words of my distress?
{2}O my God, I cry in the daytime, \
     but you do not answer; ⁕
   and by night also, but I find no rest.
{3}Yet you are the Holy One, ⁕
   enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
{4}Our forebears trusted in you; ⁕
   they trusted, and you delivered them.
{5}They cried out to you and were delivered; ⁕
   they put their trust in you and were not confounded. 
{6}But as for me, I am a worm and {ms-2: no man }, ⁕
   scorned by all and despised by the people.
{7}All who see me laugh me to scorn; ⁕
   they curl their lips and wag their heads, saying,
{8}‘{ms-3: He } trusted in {def-l: God }; let {pn-o-l: God } deliver {ms-4: him }; ⁕
   let {pn-o-l: God } deliver {ms-4: him }, if {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-s: delights } in {ms-4: him }.’
{9}But it is you that took me out of the womb ⁕
   and laid me safe upon my mother’s breast.
{10}On you was I cast ever since I was born; ⁕
   you are my God even from my mother’s womb.
{11}Be not far from me, for trouble is near at hand ⁕
   and there is none to help. 
{12}Mighty oxen come around me; ⁕
   fat bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.
{13}They gape upon me with their mouths, ⁕
   as it were a ramping and a roaring lion.
{14}I am poured out like water; \
     all my bones are out of joint; ⁕
   my heart has become like wax melting in the depths of my body.
{15}My mouth is dried up like a potsherd; \
     my tongue cleaves to my gums; ⁕
   you have laid me in the dust of death. 
{16}For the hounds are all about me, \
     the pack of evildoers close in on me; ⁕
   they pierce my hands and my feet.
{17}I can count all my bones; ⁕
   they stand staring and looking upon me.
{18}They divide my garments among them; ⁕
   they cast lots for my clothing.
{19}Be not far from me, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   you are my strength; hasten to help me.
{20}Deliver my soul from the sword, ⁕
   my poor life from the power of the dog.
{21}Save me from the lion’s mouth, \
     from the horns of wild oxen. ⁕
   You have answered me! 
{22}I will tell of your name to my people; ⁕
   in the midst of the congregation will I praise you.
{23}Praise {def-l: God }, you that fear {pn-o-l: God }; ⁕
   O descendants of Jacob, glorify {pn-o-l: God }; \
     stand in awe of {pn-o-l: God }, O descendants of Israel.
{24}For you have not despised nor abhorred the suffering of the poor; \
     neither have you hidden your face from them; ⁕
   but when they cried to you, you heard them.
{25}From you comes my praise in the great congregation; ⁕
   I will perform my vows in the presence of those that fear you.
{26}The poor shall eat and be satisfied; ⁕
   those who seek you, {voc: God }, shall praise you; \
     their hearts shall live for ever. 
{27}All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to {def-l: God }, ⁕
   and all the families of the nations shall bow before you.
{28}For the kingdom is yours, O {voc: God } ⁕
   and you rule over the nations.
{29}How can those who sleep in the earth bow down in worship, ⁕
   or those who go down to the dust kneel before you?
{30}You have saved my life for yourself; \
     my descendants shall serve you; ⁕
   this shall be told of {def-l: God } for generations to come.
{31}They shall come and make known your salvation, \
     to a people yet unborn, ⁕
   declaring that you, {def-u: God }, have done it.

   and guide me in the paths of righteousness for your name’s sake.
{4}Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, \
     I will fear no evil; ⁕
   for you are with me; \
     your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
{5}You spread a table before me in the presence of those who trouble me; ⁕
   you have anointed my head with oil \

{6}Such is the company of those who seek {pn-o-l: God }, ⁕
   of those who seek your face, O God of Jacob.

{6}I hate those who cling to worthless idols; ⁕
   I put my trust in {def-l: God }.
{7}I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy, ⁕
   for you have seen my affliction \
     and known my soul in adversity.
{8}You have not shut me up in the hand of the enemy; ⁕
   you have set my feet in an open place. 
{9}Have mercy on me, {voc: God }, for I am in trouble; ⁕
   my eye is consumed with sorrow, \
     my soul and my body also.
{10}For my life is wasted with grief, \
     and my years with sighing; ⁕
   my strength fails me because of my affliction, \
     and my bones are consumed.
{11}I have become a reproach to all my enemies \
     and even to my neighbours, \
     an object of dread to my acquaintances; ⁕
   when they see me in the street they flee from me.
{12}I am forgotten like one that is dead, out of mind; ⁕
   I have become like a broken vessel.

{14}But my trust is in you, O {voc: God }. ⁕
   I have said, ‘You are my God.

   deliver me from the hand of my enemies, \
     and from those who persecute me.
{16}‘Make your face to shine upon your servant, ⁕
   and save me for your mercy’s sake.’
{17}{voc: God }, let me not be confounded \
     for I have called upon you; ⁕
   but let the wicked be put to shame; \
     let them be silent in the grave.
{18}Let the lying lips be put to silence ⁕
   that speak against the righteous with arrogance, disdain and contempt. 
{19}How abundant is your goodness, O {voc: God }, \
     which you have laid up for those who fear you; ⁕
   which you have prepared in the sight of all for those who put their trust in you.
{20}You hide them in the shelter of your presence from those who slander them; ⁕
   you keep them safe in your refuge from the strife of tongues.
{21}Blessed be {def-l: God }! ⁕
   For you have shown me your steadfast love when I was as a city besieged.
{22}I had said in my alarm, \
     ‘I have been cut off from the sight of your eyes.’ ⁕
   Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my prayer when I cried out to you. 
{23}Love {def-l: God }, all you {pn-p-l: God’s } servants; ⁕
   for {def-l: God } protects the faithful, \
     but repays to the full the proud.
{24}Be strong and let your heart take courage, ⁕
   all you who wait in hope for {def-l: God }.

   I have not concealed your loving-kindness and truth from the great congregation. 
{12}Do not withhold your compassion from me, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   let your love and your faithfulness always preserve me,
{13}For innumerable troubles have come about me; \
     my sins have overtaken me so that I cannot look up; ⁕
   they are more in number than the hairs of my head, \
     and my heart fails me.
{14}Be pleased, O {voc: God }, to deliver me; ⁕
   O {voc: God }, make haste to help me.
{15}Let them be ashamed and altogether dismayed who seek after my life to destroy it; ⁕
   let them be driven back and put to shame who wish me evil.
{16}Let those who heap insults upon me ⁕
   be desolate because of their shame. 
{17}Let all who seek you rejoice in you and be glad; ⁕
   let those who love your salvation say always, \
     ‘{def-u: God } is great.’
{18}Though I am poor and needy, ⁕
   {def-l: God } cares for me.
{19}You are my helper and my deliverer; ⁕
   O my God, make no delay.

### {Refrain} O {voc: God }, be merciful to me.

   {def-l: God } will deliver them in the time of trouble.
{2}{def-u: God } preserves them and restores their life, \
     that they may be happy in the land; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } will not hand them over to the will of their enemies.

   their sickness, {voc: God }, you will remove.

   heal me, for I have sinned against you.’ 
{5}My enemies speak evil about me, ⁕
   asking when I shall die and my name perish.
{6}If they come to see me, they utter empty words; ⁕
   their heart gathers mischief; \
     when they go out, they tell it abroad.
{7}All my enemies whisper together against me, ⁕
   against me they devise evil,
{8}Saying that a deadly thing has laid hold on me, ⁕
   and that I will not rise again from where I lie.
{9}Even my bosom friend, whom I trusted, \
     who ate of my bread, ⁕
   has lifted up their heel against me. 
{10}But you, O {voc: God }, be merciful to me ⁕
   and raise me up, that I may reward them.
{11}By this I know that you favour me, ⁕
   that my enemy does not triumph over me.
{12}Because of my integrity you uphold me ⁕
   and will set me before your face for ever.
{13}Blessed be {def-l: God } God of Israel, ⁕
   from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.

   when shall I come before the presence of God?
{3}My tears have been my bread day and night, ⁕
   while all day long they say to me, ‘Where is now your God?’
{4}Now when I think on these things, I pour out my soul: ⁕
   how I went with the multitude \
     and led the procession to the house of God,
{5}With the voice of praise and thanksgiving, ⁕
   among those who kept holy day.
{6}<i>Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul,</i> ⁕
   <i>and why are you so disquieted within me?</i>
{7}<i>O put your trust in God;</i> ⁕
   <i>for I will yet give {pn-o-l: God } thanks, \

{8}My soul is heavy within me; ⁕
   therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, \
     and from Hermon and the hill of Mizar.
{9}Deep calls to deep in the thunder of your waterfalls; ⁕
   all your breakers and waves have gone over me.
{10}{def-u: God } will grant {pn-p-l: God’s } loving-kindness in the daytime; ⁕
   through the night {pn-p-l: God’s } song will be with me, \
     a prayer to the God of my life.
{11}I say to God my rock, \
     ‘Why have you forgotten me, ⁕
   and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresses me?’
{12}As they crush my bones, my enemies mock me; ⁕
   while all day long they say to me, ‘Where is now your God?’
{13}<i>Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul,</i> ⁕
   <i>and why are you so disquieted within me?</i>

     why have you cast me from you, ⁕
   and why go I so heavily, while the enemy oppresses me?
{3}O send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, ⁕
   and bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling,
{4}That I may go to the altar of God, \
     to the God of my joy and gladness; ⁕
   and on the lyre I will give thanks to you, O God my God.

### {Refrain} Rise up, O {voc: God }, to help us.

{1}We have heard with our ears, O God, our forebears have told us, ⁕
   all that you did in their days, in time of old;
{2}How with your hand you drove out nations and planted us in, ⁕
   and broke the power of peoples and set us free.
{3}For not by their own sword did our ancestors take the land ⁕
   nor did their own arm save them,
{4}But your right hand, your arm, and the light of your countenance, ⁕
   because you were gracious to them. 
{5}You are my Sovereign and my God, ⁕
   who commanded salvation for Jacob.
{6}Through you we drove back our adversaries; ⁕
   through your name we trod down our foes.
{7}For I did not trust in my bow; ⁕
   it was not my own sword that saved me;
{8}It was you that saved us from our enemies ⁕
   and put our adversaries to shame.
{9}We gloried in God all the day long, ⁕
   and were ever praising your name. 
{10}But now you have rejected us and brought us to shame, ⁕
   and go not out with our armies.
{11}You have made us turn our backs on our enemies, ⁕
   and our enemies have despoiled us.
{12}You have made us like sheep to be slaughtered, ⁕
   and have scattered us among the nations.
{13}You have sold your people for a pittance ⁕
   and made no profit on their sale.
{14}You have made us the taunt of our neighbours, ⁕
   the scorn and derision of those that are round about us.
{15}You have made us a byword among the nations; ⁕
   among the peoples they wag their heads. 
{16}My confusion is daily before me, ⁕
   and shame has covered my face,
{17}At the taunts of the slanderer and reviler, ⁕
   at the sight of the enemy and avenger.
{18}All this has come upon us, \
     though we have not forgotten you ⁕
   and have not played false to your covenant.
{19}Our hearts have not turned back, ⁕
   nor our steps gone out of your way,
{20}Yet you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, ⁕
   and covered us with the shadow of death.
{21}If we have forgotten the name of our God, ⁕
   or stretched out our hands to any strange god,
{22}Will not God search it out? ⁕
   For {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-s: know } the secrets of the heart.
{23}But for your sake are we killed all the day long, ⁕
   and are counted as sheep for the slaughter. 
{24}Rise up! Why sleep, O {voc: God }? ⁕
   Awake, and do not reject us for ever.
{25}Why do you hide your face ⁕
   and forget our grief and oppression?
{26}Our soul is bowed down to the dust; ⁕
   our belly cleaves to the earth.
{27}Rise up, O {voc: God }, to help us ⁕
   and redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.

{6}Your throne is God’s throne, for ever; ⁕
   the sceptre of your kingdom is the sceptre of righteousness.

{5}Why should I fear in evil days, ⁕
   when the malice of my foes surrounds me,
{6}Such as trust in their goods ⁕
   and glory in the abundance of their riches?
{7}For no one can indeed ransom another ⁕
   or pay to God the price of deliverance.
{8}To ransom a soul is too costly; ⁕
   there is no price one could pay for it,
{9}So that they might live for ever, ⁕
   and never see the grave.
{10}For we see that the wise die also; \
     with the foolish and ignorant they perish ⁕
   and leave their riches to others.
{11}Their tomb is their home for ever, \
     their dwelling through all generations, ⁕
   though they call their lands after their own names.
{12}Those who have honour, but lack understanding, ⁕
   are like the beasts that perish. 
{13}Such is the way of those who boast in themselves, ⁕
   the end of those who delight in their own words.
{14}Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die; \
     death is their shepherd; ⁕
   they go down straight to the Pit.

   from the grasp of death will {pn-s-l: God } take me.

{19}Though they count themselves happy while they live ⁕
   and praise you for your success,

{10}Confuse their tongues, O {voc: God }, and divide them, ⁕
   for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
{11}Day and night they go about on its walls; ⁕
   mischief and trouble are in its midst.
{12}Wickedness walks in its streets; ⁕
   oppression and guile never leave its squares. 
{13}For it was not an open enemy that reviled me, ⁕
   for then I could have borne it;
{14}Nor was it my adversary that puffed themself up against me, ⁕
   for then I would have hid myself from them.
{15}But it was even you, one like myself, ⁕
   my companion and my own familiar friend.
{16}We took sweet counsel together ⁕
   and walked with the multitude in the house of God.
{17}Let death come suddenly upon them; \
     let them go down alive to the Pit; ⁕
   for wickedness inhabits their dwellings, their very hearts. 
{18}As for me, I will call upon God ⁕
   and {def-l: God } will deliver me.
{19}In the evening and morning and at noonday \
     I will pray and make my supplication, ⁕
   and {pn-s-l: God } shall hear my voice.
{20}{pn-s-u: God } shall redeem my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, ⁕
   for many have come upon me.
{21}God, who is enthroned of old, \
     will hear and bring them down; ⁕
   they will not repent, for they have no fear of God. 
{22}My companion stretched out their hands against their friend ⁕
   and has broken their covenant;
{23}Their speech was softer than butter, though war was in their heart; ⁕
   their words were smoother than oil, yet are they naked swords.
{24}Cast your burden upon {def-l: God } and {pn-s-l: God } will sustain you, ⁕
   and will not let the righteous fall for ever.
{25}But those that are bloodthirsty and deceitful, O God, ⁕
   you will bring down to the pit of destruction.
{26}They shall not live out half their days, ⁕
   but my trust shall be in you, O {voc: God }.

### {Refrain} In God I trust, and will not fear.

{1}Have mercy on me, O God, for they trample over me; ⁕
   all day long they assault and oppress me.
{2}My adversaries trample over me all the day long; ⁕
   many are they that make proud war against me.
{3}In the day of my fear I put my trust in you, ⁕
   in God whose word I praise.
{4}In God I trust, and will not fear, ⁕
   for what can flesh do to me? 
{5}All day long they wound me with words; ⁕
   their every thought is to do me evil.
{6}They stir up trouble; they lie in wait; ⁕
   marking my steps, they seek my life.
{7}Shall they escape for all their wickedness? ⁕
   In anger, O God, cast the peoples down.
{8}You have counted up my groaning; \
     put my tears into your bottle; ⁕
   are they not written in your book? 
{9}Then shall my enemies turn back on the day when I call upon you; ⁕
   this I know, for God is on my side.
{10}In God whose word I praise, \
     in {def-l: God } whose word I praise, ⁕
   in God I trust and will not fear: \
     what can flesh do to me?
{11}To you, O God, will I fulfil my vows; ⁕
   to you will I present my offerings of thanks,
{12}For you will deliver my soul from death \
     and my feet from falling, ⁕
   that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

# Psalm 57

{1}Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, ⁕

   until the storm of destruction has passed by.
{3}I will call upon the Most High God, ⁕
   the God who fulfils {pn-p-l: God’s } purpose for me.
{4}{pn-s-u: God } will send from heaven and save me \
     and rebuke those that would trample upon me; ⁕
   God will send forth love and faithfulness.
{5}I lie in the midst of lions, ⁕
   people whose teeth are spears and arrows, \
     and their tongue a sharp sword.
{6}Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, ⁕
   and your glory over all the earth.
{7}They have laid a net for my feet; \
     my soul is pressed down; ⁕
   they have dug a pit before me \
     and will fall into it themselves.
{8}My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready; ⁕
   I will sing and give you praise.
{9}Awake, my soul; awake, harp and lyre, ⁕
   that I may awaken the dawn.
{10}I will give you thanks, O {voc: God }, among the peoples; ⁕
   I will sing praise to you among the nations.
{11}For your loving-kindness is as high as the heavens, ⁕
   and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
{12}Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, ⁕
   and your glory over all the earth.

   your hands mete out violence.
{3}The wicked are estranged, even from the womb; ⁕
   those who speak falsehood go astray from their birth.
{4}They are as venomous as a serpent; ⁕
   they are like the deaf adder which stops its ears,
{5}Which does not heed the voice of the charmers, ⁕
   and is deaf to the skilful weaver of spells. 
{6}Break, O God, their teeth in their mouths; ⁕
   smash the fangs of these lions, O {voc: God }.
{7}Let them vanish like water that runs away; ⁕
   let them wither like trodden grass.
{8}Let them be as the slimy track of the snail, ⁕
   like the untimely birth that never sees the sun.
{9}Before ever their pots feel the heat of the thorns, ⁕
   green or blazing, let them be swept away.
{10}The righteous will be glad when they see God’s vengeance; ⁕
   they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
{11}So that people will say, \
     ‘Truly, there is a harvest for the righteous; ⁕
   truly, there is a God who judges in the earth.’

{4}Not for any fault or sin of mine, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   for no offence, they run and prepare themselves for war.
{5}Rouse yourself, come to my aid and see; ⁕

   show no mercy to the evil traitors.

   and prowl about the city.
{17}Though they forage for something to devour, ⁕
   and howl if they are not filled,

   though wealth increase, set not your heart upon it.

{9}My soul clings to you; ⁕
   your right hand shall hold me fast. 
{10}But those who seek my soul to destroy it ⁕
   shall go down to the depths of the earth;

   from the gathering of evildoers.
{3}They sharpen their tongue like a sword ⁕
   and aim their bitter words like arrows,

   suddenly they shoot, and are not seen.
{5}They hold fast to their evil course; ⁕
   they talk of laying snares, saying, ‘Who will see us?’
{6}They search out wickedness and lay a cunning trap, ⁕
   for deep are the inward thoughts of the heart. 
{7}But God will shoot at them with {pn-p-l: God’s } swift arrow, ⁕

   you prepare grain for your people, \

   and the drunkards make songs about me. 
{14}But as for me, I make my prayer to you, O {voc: God }; ⁕
   at an acceptable time, O God.
{15}Answer me, O God, in the abundance of your mercy ⁕
   and with your sure salvation.
{16}Draw me out of the mire, that I sink not; ⁕
   let me be rescued from those who hate me \
     and out of the deep waters. 
{17}Let not the water flood drown me, \
     neither the deep swallow me up; ⁕
   let not the Pit shut its mouth upon me.
{18}Answer me, {voc: God }, for your loving-kindness is good; ⁕
   turn to me in the multitude of your mercies.
{19}Hide not your face from your servant; ⁕
   be swift to answer me, for I am in trouble. 
{20}Draw near to my soul and redeem me; ⁕
   deliver me because of my enemies.
{21}You know my reproach, my shame and my dishonour; ⁕
   my adversaries are all in your sight.
{22}Reproach has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness. ⁕
   I looked for some to have pity, but there was no one, \
     neither found I any to comfort me.
{23}They gave me gall to eat, ⁕
   and when I was thirsty, they gave me vinegar to drink. 
{24}Let the table before them be a trap ⁕
   and their sacred feasts a snare.
{25}Let their eyes be darkened, that they cannot see, ⁕
   and give them continual trembling in their loins.
{26}Pour out your indignation upon them, ⁕
   and let the heat of your anger overtake them.
{27}Let their camp be desolate, ⁕
   and let there be no one to dwell in their tents. 
{28}For they persecute the one whom you have stricken, ⁕
   and increase the sorrows of the one whom you have pierced.
{29}Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, ⁕
   and let them not receive your vindication.
{30}Let them be wiped out of the book of the living ⁕
   and not be written among the righteous. 
{31}As for me, I am poor and in misery; ⁕
   your saving help, O God, will lift me up.
{32}I will praise the name of God with a song; ⁕
   I will proclaim {pn-p-l: God’s } greatness with thanksgiving.
{33}This will please {def-l: God } more than an offering of oxen, ⁕
   more than bulls with horns and hooves.
{34}The humble shall see and be glad; ⁕
   you who seek God, your heart shall live. 
{35}For {def-l: God } listens to the needy, ⁕
   and {pn-p-l: God’s } own who are imprisoned {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-es: does } not despise.
{36}Let the heavens and the earth praise {pn-o-l: God }, ⁕
   the seas and all that moves in them;
{37}For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; ⁕
   they shall live there and have it in possession.
{38}The children of {pn-p-l: God’s } servants shall inherit it, ⁕
   and they that love {pn-p-l: God’s } name shall dwell therein.

### {Refrain} O God, be not far from me.

{1}In you, O {voc: God }, do I seek refuge; ⁕
   let me never be put to shame.
{2}In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; ⁕
   incline your ear to me and save me.
{3}Be for me a stronghold to which I may ever resort; ⁕
   send out to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
{4}Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, ⁕
   from the grasp of the evildoer and the oppressor.
{5}For you are my hope, O {voc: God } God, ⁕
   my confidence, even from my youth.
{6}Upon you have I leaned from my birth, \
     when you drew me from my mother’s womb; ⁕
   my praise shall be always of you. 
{7}I have become a portent to many, ⁕
   but you are my refuge and my strength.
{8}Let my mouth be full of your praise ⁕
   and your glory all the day long.
{9}Do not cast me away in the time of old age; ⁕
   forsake me not when my strength fails.
{10}For my enemies are talking against me, ⁕
   and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.
{11}They say, ‘God has forsaken them; \
     pursue them and take them, ⁕
   because there is none to deliver them.’
{12}O God, be not far from me; ⁕
   come quickly to help me, O my God.
{13}Let those who are against me be put to shame and disgrace; ⁕
   let those who seek to do me evil be covered with scorn and reproach. 
{14}But as for me I will hope continually ⁕
   and will praise you more and more.
{15}My mouth shall tell of your righteousness \
     and salvation all the day long, ⁕
   for I know no end of the telling.
{16}I will begin with the mighty works of {def-l: God } God; ⁕
   I will recall your righteousness, yours alone. 
{17}O God, you have taught me since I was young, ⁕
   and to this day I tell of your wonderful works.
{18}Forsake me not, O God, \
     when I am old and grey-headed, ⁕
   till I make known your deeds to the next generation \
     and your power to all that are to come.
{19}Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; ⁕
   in the great things you have done, who is like you, O God?
{20}What troubles and adversities you have shown me, ⁕
   and yet you will turn and refresh me \
     and bring me from the deep of the earth again.
{21}Increase my honour; ⁕
   turn again and comfort me. 
{22}Therefore will I praise you upon the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; ⁕
   I will sing to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
{23}My lips will sing out as I play to you, ⁕
   and so will my soul, which you have redeemed.
{24}My tongue also will tell of your righteousness all the day long, ⁕
   for they shall be shamed and disgraced who sought to do me evil.

# Psalm 73

### {Refrain} In {def-l: God } God have I made my refuge.

{1}Truly, God is loving to Israel, ⁕
   to those who are pure in heart.
{2}Nevertheless, my feet were almost gone; ⁕
   my steps had well-nigh slipped.
{3}For I was envious of the proud; ⁕
   I saw the wicked in such prosperity;
{4}For they suffer no pains ⁕
   and their bodies are sleek and sound;
{5}They come to no misfortune like other folk; ⁕
   nor are they plagued as others are;
{6}Therefore pride is their necklace ⁕
   and violence wraps them like a cloak.
{7}Their iniquity comes from within; ⁕
   the conceits of their hearts overflow. 
{8}They scoff, and speak only of evil; ⁕
   they talk of oppression from on high.
{9}They set their mouth against the heavens, ⁕
   and their tongue ranges round the earth;
{10}And so the people turn to them ⁕
   and find in them no fault.
{11}They say, ‘How should God know? ⁕
   Is there knowledge in the Most High?’
{12}Behold, these are the wicked; ⁕
   ever at ease, they increase their wealth.
{13}Is it in vain that I cleansed my heart ⁕
   and washed my hands in innocence?
{14}All day long have I been stricken ⁕
   and chastened every morning.
{15}If I had said, ‘I will speak as they do,’ ⁕
   I should have betrayed the generation of your children. 
{16}Then thought I to understand this, ⁕
   but it was too hard for me,
{17}Until I entered the sanctuary of God ⁕
   and understood the end of the wicked:
{18}How you set them in slippery places; ⁕
   you cast them down to destruction.
{19}How suddenly do they come to destruction, ⁕
   perish and come to a fearful end!
{20}As with a dream when one awakes, ⁕
   so, {voc: God }, when you arise you will despise their image.
{21}When my heart became embittered ⁕
   and I was pierced to the quick,
{22}I was but foolish and ignorant; ⁕
   I was like a brute beast in your presence. 
{23}Yet I am always with you; ⁕
   you hold me by my right hand.
{24}You will guide me with your counsel ⁕
   and afterwards receive me with glory.
{25}Whom have I in heaven but you? ⁕
   And there is nothing upon earth that I desire in comparison with you.
{26}Though my flesh and my heart fail me, ⁕
   God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
{27}Truly, those who forsake you will perish; ⁕
   you will put to silence the faithless who betray you.
{28}But it is good for me to draw near to God; ⁕
   in {def-l: God } God have I made my refuge, \
     that I may tell of all your works.

# Psalm 74

### {Refrain} Arise, O God, maintain your own cause.

{1}O God, why have you utterly disowned us? ⁕
   Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
{2}Remember your congregation that you purchased of old, ⁕
   the tribe you redeemed for your own possession, \
     and Mount Zion where you dwelt.
{3}Hasten your steps towards the endless ruins, ⁕
   where the enemy has laid waste all your sanctuary.
{4}Your adversaries roared in the place of your worship; ⁕
   they set up their banners as tokens of victory.
{5}Like people brandishing axes on high in a thicket of trees, ⁕
   all the carved work they smashed down with hatchet and hammer.
{6}They set fire to your holy place; ⁕
   they defiled the dwelling place of your name \
     and razed it to the ground.
{7}They said in their heart, ‘Let us make havoc of them altogether,’ ⁕
   and they burned down all the sanctuaries of God in the land.
{8}There are no signs to see, not one prophet left, ⁕
   not one among us who knows how long.
{9}How long, O God, will the adversary scoff? ⁕
   Shall the enemy blaspheme your name for ever?
{10}Why have you withheld your hand ⁕
   and hidden your right hand in your bosom? 
{11}Yet God is my Sovereign from of old, ⁕
   who did deeds of salvation in the midst of the earth.
{12}It was you that divided the sea by your might ⁕
   and shattered the heads of the dragons on the waters;
{13}You alone crushed the heads of Leviathan ⁕
   and gave them to the beasts of the desert for food.
{14}You cleft the rock for fountain and flood; ⁕
   you dried up ever-flowing rivers.
{15}Yours is the day, yours also the night; ⁕
   you established the moon and the sun.
{16}You set all the bounds of the earth; ⁕
   you fashioned both summer and winter. 
{17}Remember now, {voc: God }, how the enemy scoffed, ⁕
   how a foolish people despised your name.
{18}Do not give to wild beasts the soul of your turtle dove; ⁕
   forget not the lives of your poor for ever.
{19}Look upon your creation, \
     for the earth is full of darkness, ⁕
   full of the haunts of violence.
{20}Let not the oppressed turn away ashamed, ⁕
   but let the poor and needy praise your name.
{21}Arise, O God, maintain your own cause; ⁕
   remember how fools revile you all the day long.
{22}Forget not the clamour of your adversaries, ⁕
   the tumult of your enemies that ascends continually.

   well mixed and full of foaming wine.

   the shield, the sword and the weapons of war. 
{4}In the light of splendour you appeared, ⁕
   glorious from the eternal mountains.
{5}The boastful were plundered; they have slept their sleep; ⁕
   none of the warriors can lift their hand.
{6}At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, ⁕
   both horse and chariot fell stunned. 
{7}Terrible are you in majesty: ⁕
   who can stand before your face when you are angry?
{8}You caused your judgement to be heard from heaven; ⁕
   the earth trembled and was still,
{9}When God arose to judgement, ⁕
   to save all the meek upon earth. 
{10}You crushed the wrath of the peoples ⁕
   and bridled the wrathful remnant.
{11}Make a vow to {def-l: God } your God and keep it; ⁕
   let all who are round about {pn-o-l: God } bring gifts to {pn-o-l: God } that is worthy to be feared.

   I cry aloud to God and {pn-s-l: God } will hear me.
{2}In the day of my trouble I have sought {def-l: God }; ⁕
   by night my hand is stretched out and does not tire; \
     my soul refuses comfort.
{3}I think upon God and I groan; ⁕
   I ponder, and my spirit faints.
{4}You will not let my eyelids close; ⁕
   I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
{5}I consider the days of old; ⁕

{6}I commune with my heart in the night; ⁕
   my spirit searches for understanding.
{7}Will {def-l: God } cast us off for ever? ⁕

   the children of Jacob and Joseph. 
{16}The waters saw you, O God; \
     the waters saw you and were afraid; ⁕
   the depths also were troubled.
{17}The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; ⁕
   your arrows flashed on every side;
{18}The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind; \
     your lightnings lit up the ground; ⁕
   the earth trembled and shook.
{19}Your way was in the sea, and your paths in the great waters, ⁕

# Psalm 78

### {Refrain} O {voc: God }, how glorious are your works.

{1}Hear my teaching, O my people; ⁕
   incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
{2}I will open my mouth in a parable; ⁕
   I will pour forth mysteries from of old,
{3}Such as we have heard and known, ⁕
   which our forebears have told us.
{4}We will not hide from their children, \
     but will recount to generations to come, ⁕
   the praises of {def-l: God } and {pn-p-l: God’s } power \
     and the wonderful works {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-has: has } done. 
{5}{pn-s-u: God } laid a solemn charge on Jacob \
     and made it a law in Israel, ⁕
   which {pn-s-l: God } commanded them to teach their children,
{6}That the generations to come might know, \
     and the children yet unborn, ⁕
   that they in turn might tell it to their children;
{7}So that they might put their trust in God ⁕
   and not forget the deeds of God, \
     but keep {pn-p-l: God’s } commandments,
{8}And not be like their forebears, \
     a stubborn and rebellious generation, ⁕
   a generation whose heart was not steadfast, \
     and whose spirit was not faithful to God. 
{9}The people of Ephraim, armed with the bow, ⁕
   turned back in the day of battle;
{10}They did not keep the covenant of God ⁕
   and refused to walk in {pn-p-l: God’s } law;
{11}They forgot what {pn-s-l: God } had done ⁕
   and the wonders {pn-s-l: God } had shown them.
{12}For {pn-s-l: God } did marvellous things in the sight of their forebears, ⁕
   in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
{13}{pn-s-u: God } divided the sea and let them pass through; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } made the waters stand still in a heap.
{14}{pn-s-u: God } led them with a cloud by day ⁕
   and all the night through with a blaze of fire.
{15}{pn-s-u: God } split the hard rocks in the wilderness ⁕
   and gave them drink as from the great deep.
{16}{pn-s-u: God } brought streams out of the rock ⁕
   and made water gush out like rivers. 
{17}Yet for all this they sinned more against {pn-o-l: God } ⁕
   and defied the Most High in the wilderness.
{18}They tested God in their hearts ⁕
   and demanded food for their craving.
{19}They spoke against God and said, ⁕
   ‘Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
{20}‘He struck the rock indeed, so that the waters gushed out \
     and the streams overflowed, ⁕
   but can {pn-s-l: God } give bread or provide meat for {pn-p-l: God’s } people?’ 
{21}{def-u: God } heard this and was full of wrath; ⁕
   a fire was kindled against Jacob \
     and {pn-p-l: God’s } anger went out against Israel,
{22}For they had no faith in God ⁕
   and put no trust in {pn-p-l: God’s } saving help.
{23}So {pn-s-l: God } commanded the clouds above ⁕
   and opened the doors of heaven.
{24}{pn-s-u: God } rained down upon them manna to eat ⁕
   and gave them the grain of heaven.
{25}So mortals ate the bread of angels; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } sent them food in plenty. 
{26}{pn-s-u: God } caused the east wind to blow in the heavens ⁕
   and led out the south wind by {pn-p-l: God’s } might.
{27}{pn-s-u: God } rained flesh upon them as thick as dust ⁕
   and winged fowl like the sand of the sea.
{28}{pn-s-u: God } let it fall in the midst of their camp ⁕
   and round about their tents.
{29}So they ate and were well filled, ⁕
   for {pn-s-l: God } gave them what they desired.
{30}But they did not stop their craving; ⁕
   their food was still in their mouths,
{31}When the anger of God rose against them, ⁕
   and slew their strongest men \
     and felled the flower of Israel. 
{32}But for all this, they sinned yet more ⁕
   and put no faith in {pn-p-l: God’s } wonderful works.
{33}So {pn-s-l: God } brought their days to an end like a breath ⁕
   and their years in sudden terror.
{34}Whenever {pn-s-l: God } slew them, they would seek {pn-o-l: God }; ⁕
   they would repent and earnestly search for God.
{35}They remembered that God was their rock ⁕
   and the Most High God their redeemer. 
{36}Yet they did but flatter {pn-o-l: God } with their mouth ⁕
   and dissembled with their tongue.
{37}Their heart was not steadfast towards {pn-o-l: God }, ⁕
   neither were they faithful to {pn-p-l: God’s } covenant.
{38}But {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-was: was } so merciful that {pn-s-l: God } forgave their misdeeds \
     and did not destroy them; ⁕
   many a time {pn-s-l: God } turned back from wrath \
     and did not suffer {pn-p-l: God’s } whole displeasure to be roused.
{39}For {pn-s-l: God } remembered that they were but flesh, ⁕
   a wind that passes by and does not return.

{42}They did not remember {pn-p-l: God’s } power ⁕
   in the day when {pn-s-l: God } redeemed them from the enemy;

{48}{pn-s-u: God } delivered their cattle to hailstones ⁕
   and their flocks to thunderbolts.
{49}{pn-s-u: God } set loose on them a blazing anger: ⁕
   fury, displeasure and trouble, \
     a troop of destroying angels.
{50}{pn-s-u: God } made a way for anger \
     and spared not their souls from death, ⁕
   but gave their life over to the pestilence.
{51}{pn-s-u: God } smote the firstborn of Egypt, ⁕
   the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
{52}But {pn-s-l: God } led out the people like sheep ⁕
   and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
{53}{pn-s-u: God } led them to safety and they were not afraid, ⁕
   but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
{54}{pn-s-u: God } brought them to {pn-p-l: God’s } holy place, ⁕
   the mountain which {pn-p-l: God’s } right hand took in possession.
{55}{pn-s-u: God } drove out the nations before them \
     and shared out to them their inheritance; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 
{56}Yet still they tested God Most High \
     and rebelled against {pn-o-l: God }, ⁕
   and would not keep {pn-p-l: God’s } commandments.
{57}They turned back and fell away like their forebears, ⁕
   starting aside like an unstrung bow.
{58}They grieved {pn-o-l: God } with their hill altars ⁕
   and provoked {pn-o-l: God } to displeasure with their idols.
{59}God heard and was greatly angered, ⁕
   and utterly rejected Israel. 
{60}{pn-s-u: God } forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, ⁕
   the tent of {pn-p-l: God’s } presence on earth.
{61}{pn-s-u: God } gave the ark of {pn-p-l: God’s } strength into captivity, ⁕
   {pn-p-l: God’s } splendour into the adversary’s hand.
{62}{pn-s-u: God } delivered {pn-p-l: God’s } own people to the sword ⁕
   and raged against {pn-p-l: God’s } inheritance.
{63}The fire consumed their youths; ⁕
   there was no one to lament their young.
{64}Their priests fell by the sword, ⁕
   and their bereaved made no lamentation. 
{65}Then {def-l: God } woke as out of sleep, ⁕
   like a warrior who had been overcome with wine.
{66}{pn-s-u: God } struck the enemies from behind ⁕
   and put them to perpetual shame.
{67}{pn-s-u: God } rejected the tent of Joseph ⁕
   and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
{68}But {pn-s-l: God } chose the tribe of Judah ⁕
   and the hill of Zion, which {pn-s-l: God } loved. 
{69}And there {pn-s-l: God } built the sanctuary like the heights of heaven, ⁕
   like the earth which {pn-s-l: God } founded for ever.
{70}{pn-s-u: God } chose David also, {pn-p-l: God’s } servant, ⁕
   and took him away from the sheepfolds.
{71}From following the ewes with their lambs {pn-s-l: God } took him, ⁕
   that he might shepherd Jacob {pn-p-l: God’s } people \
     and Israel {pn-p-l: God’s } inheritance.
{72}So he shepherded them with a devoted heart ⁕
   and with skilful hands he guided them.

### {Refrain} Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.

     and made Jerusalem a heap of stones.
{2}The dead bodies of your servants they have given to be food for the birds of the air, ⁕
   and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the field.
{3}Their blood have they shed like water on every side of Jerusalem, ⁕
   and there was no one to bury them.
{4}We have become the taunt of our neighbours, ⁕
   the scorn and derision of those that are round about us.

   How long will your jealous fury blaze like fire?
{6}Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, ⁕
   and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your name.
{7}For they have devoured Jacob ⁕
   and laid waste his dwelling place. 
{8}Remember not against us our former sins; ⁕
   let your compassion make haste to meet us, \
     for we are brought very low.
{9}Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; ⁕
   deliver us, and wipe away our sins for your name’s sake.
{10}Why should the heathen say, ⁕
   ‘Where is now their God?’ 
{11}Let vengeance for your servants’ blood that is shed ⁕
   be known among the nations in our sight.
{12}Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before you, ⁕

{4}Turn us again, O God; ⁕
   show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
{5}O {voc: God } God of hosts, ⁕
   how long will you be angry at your people’s prayer?
{6}You feed them with the bread of tears; ⁕
   you give them abundance of tears to drink.
{7}You have made us the derision of our neighbours, ⁕
   and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
{8}Turn us again, O God of hosts; ⁕
   show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.
{9}You brought a vine out of Egypt; ⁕
   you drove out the nations and planted it.
{10}You made room around it, ⁕
   and when it had taken root, it filled the land.
{11}The hills were covered with its shadow ⁕
   and the cedars of God by its boughs.
{12}It stretched out its branches to the Sea ⁕
   and its tendrils to the River.
{13}Why then have you broken down its wall, ⁕
   so that all who pass by pluck off its grapes?
{14}The wild boar out of the wood tears it off, ⁕
   and all the insects of the field devour it.
{15}Turn again, O God of hosts, ⁕
   look down from heaven and behold;
{16}Cherish this vine which your right hand has planted, ⁕
   and the branch that you made so strong for yourself.
{17}Let those who burnt it with fire, who cut it down, ⁕
   perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
{18}Let your hand be upon the one at your right hand, ⁕
   the {ms-1: Son of Man } you made so strong for yourself.
{19}And so will we not go back from you; ⁕
   give us life, and we shall call upon your name.
{20}Turn us again, O {voc: God } God of hosts; ⁕
   show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved.

{2}Take up the song and sound the timbrel, ⁕
   the tuneful lyre with the harp.
{3}Blow the trumpet at the new moon, ⁕
   as at the full moon, upon our solemn feast day.
{4}For this is a statute for Israel, ⁕
   a law of the God of Jacob,
{5}The charge {pn-s-l: God } laid on the people of Joseph, ⁕
   when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
{6}I heard a voice I did not know, that said: ⁕
   ‘I eased their shoulder from the burden; \
     their hands were set free from bearing the load.
{7}‘You called upon me in trouble and I delivered you; ⁕
   I answered you from the secret place of thunder \
     and proved you at the waters of Meribah.
{8}‘Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you: ⁕
   O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
{9}‘There shall be no strange god among you; ⁕
   you shall not worship a foreign god.
{10}‘I am {def-l: God } your God, \
     who brought you up from the land of Egypt; ⁕
   open your mouth wide and I shall fill it.’ 
{11}But my people would not hear my voice ⁕
   and Israel would not obey me.
{12}So I sent them away in the stubbornness of their hearts, ⁕
   and let them walk after their own counsels.
{13}O that my people would listen to me, ⁕
   that Israel would walk in my ways!
{14}Then I should soon put down their enemies ⁕
   and turn my hand against their adversaries.
{15}Those who hate {def-l: God } would be humbled before {pn-o-l: God }, ⁕
   and their punishment would last for ever.

{4}They say, ‘Come, let us destroy them as a nation, ⁕
   that the name of Israel be remembered no more.’ 
{5}They have conspired together with one mind; ⁕
   they are in league against you:
{6}The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, ⁕
   Moab and the Hagarenes,

{5}You sweep them away like a dream; ⁕
   they fade away suddenly like the grass.
{6}In the morning it is green and flourishes; ⁕
   in the evening it is dried up and withered. 
{7}For we consume away in your displeasure; ⁕
   we are afraid at your wrathful indignation.
{8}You have set our misdeeds before you ⁕
   and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
{9}When you are angry, all our days are gone; ⁕
   our years come to an end like a sigh.
{10}The days of our life are three score years and ten, \
     or if our strength endures, even four score; ⁕
   yet the sum of them is but labour and sorrow, \
     for they soon pass away and we are gone.
{11}Who regards the power of your wrath ⁕
   and your indignation like those who fear you?
{12}So teach us to number our days ⁕
   that we may apply our hearts to wisdom. 
{13}Turn again, O {voc: God }; how long will you delay? ⁕
   Have compassion on your servants.
{14}Satisfy us with your loving-kindness in the morning, ⁕
   that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
{15}Give us gladness for the days you have afflicted us, ⁕
   and for the years in which we have seen adversity.
{16}Show your servants your works, ⁕
   and let your glory be over their children.
{17}May the gracious favour of {def-l: God } our God be upon us; ⁕
   prosper our handiwork; O prosper the work of our hands.

   and lay the beams of your dwelling place in the waters above.
{4}You make the clouds your chariot ⁕
   and ride on the wings of the wind.
{5}You make the winds your messengers ⁕
   and flames of fire your servants. 
{6}You laid the foundations of the earth, ⁕
   that it never should move at any time.
{7}You covered it with the deep like a garment; ⁕
   the waters stood high above the hills.
{8}At your rebuke they fled; ⁕
   at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.
{9}They rose up to the hills and flowed down to the valleys beneath, ⁕
   to the place which you had appointed for them.
{10}You have set them their bounds that they should not pass, ⁕
   nor turn again to cover the earth. 
{11}You send the springs into the brooks, ⁕
   which run among the hills.
{12}They give drink to every beast of the field, ⁕
   and the wild asses quench their thirst.
{13}Beside them the birds of the air make their nests ⁕
   and sing among the branches.
{14}You water the hills from your dwelling on high; ⁕
   the earth is filled with the fruit of your works. 
{15}You make grass to grow for the cattle ⁕
   and plants to meet our needs,
{16}Bringing forth food from the earth ⁕
   and wine to gladden our hearts,
{17}Oil to give us a cheerful countenance ⁕
   and bread to strengthen our hearts.
{18}The trees of {def-l: God } are full of sap, ⁕
   the cedars of Lebanon which {pn-s-l: God } planted,
{19}In which the birds build their nests, ⁕
   while the fir trees are a dwelling for the stork.
{20}The mountains are a refuge for the wild goats ⁕
   and the stony cliffs for the conies. 
{21}You appointed the moon to mark the seasons, ⁕
   and the sun knows the time for its setting.
{22}You make darkness that it may be night, ⁕
   in which all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
{23}The lions roar for their prey ⁕
   and seek their food from God.
{24}The sun rises and they are gone ⁕
   to lay themselves down in their dens.
{25}People go forth to their work ⁕
   and to their labour until the evening. 
{26}O {voc: God }, how manifold are your works! ⁕
   In wisdom you have made them all; \
     the earth is full of your creatures.
{27}There is the sea, spread far and wide, ⁕
   and there move creatures beyond number, both small and great.
{28}There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan ⁕
   which you have made to play in the deep.
{29}All of these look to you ⁕
   to give them their food in due season.
{30}When you give it them, they gather it; ⁕
   you open your hand and they are filled with good.
{31}When you hide your face they are troubled; ⁕
   when you take away their breath, \
     they die and return again to the dust.
{32}When you send forth your spirit, they are created, ⁕
   and you renew the face of the earth. 
{33}May the glory of {def-l: God } endure for ever; ⁕
   may {def-l: God } rejoice in {pn-p-l: God’s } works;
{34}{pn-s-u: God } {pn-v-s: looks } on the earth and it trembles; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-es: touches } the mountains and they smoke.
{35}I will sing to {def-l: God } as long as I live; ⁕
   I will make music to my God while I have my being.
{36}So shall my song please {pn-o-l: God } ⁕
   while I rejoice in {def-l: God }.
{37}Let sinners be consumed out of the earth \
     and the wicked be no more. ⁕
   Bless {def-l: God }, O my soul. \
     Alleluia.

{5}Remember the marvels {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-has: has } done, ⁕
   {pn-p-l: God’s } wonders and the judgements of {pn-p-l: God’s } mouth,
{6}O descendants of Abraham {pn-p-l: God’s } servant, ⁕
   O children of Jacob {pn-p-l: God’s } chosen. 
{7}{def-u: God } is our God; ⁕
   {pn-p-l: God’s } judgements are in all the earth.
{8}{pn-s-u: God } {pn-v-has: has } always been mindful of {pn-p-l: God’s } covenant, ⁕
   the promise that {pn-s-l: God } made for a thousand generations:
{9}The covenant {pn-s-l: God } made with Abraham, ⁕
   the oath that {pn-s-l: God } swore to Isaac,
{10}Which {pn-s-l: God } established as a statute for Jacob, ⁕
   an everlasting covenant for Israel,
{11}Saying, ‘To you will I give the land of Canaan ⁕
   to be the portion of your inheritance.’ 
{12}When they were but few in number, ⁕
   of little account, and sojourners in the land,
{13}Wandering from nation to nation, ⁕
   from one kingdom to another people,
{14}{pn-s-u: God } suffered no one to do them wrong ⁕
   and rebuked even rulers for their sake,
{15}Saying, ‘Touch not my anointed ⁕
   and do my prophets no harm.’ 
{16}Then {pn-s-l: God } called down famine over the land ⁕
   and broke every staff of bread.
{17}But {pn-s-l: God } had sent a man before them, ⁕
   Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
{18}They shackled his feet with fetters; ⁕
   his neck was ringed with iron.
{19}Until all {pn-s-l: God } foretold came to pass, ⁕
   the word of {def-l: God } tested him.
{20}The Sovereign sent and released him; ⁕
   the ruler of peoples set him free.
{21}{pn-s-u: God } appointed him Lord of his household ⁕
   and ruler of all {pn-s-l: God } possessed,
{22}To instruct his princes as {pn-s-l: God } willed ⁕
   and to teach his counsellors wisdom. 
{23}Then Israel came into Egypt; ⁕
   Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
{24}And {def-l: God } made his people exceedingly fruitful; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } made them too many for their adversaries,
{25}Whose heart {pn-s-l: God } turned, so that they hated {pn-p-l: God’s } people ⁕
   and dealt craftily with {pn-p-l: God’s } servants. 
{26}Then Moses {pn-p-l: God’s } servant was sent, ⁕
   and Aaron whom {pn-s-l: God } had chosen.
{27}{pn-s-u: God } showed signs through their word ⁕
   and wonders in the land of Ham.
{28}{pn-s-u: God } sent darkness and it grew dark; ⁕
   yet they did not heed {pn-p-l: God’s } words.
{29}{pn-s-u: God } turned their waters into blood ⁕
   and slew all their fish.
{30}Their land swarmed with frogs, ⁕
   even in their rulers’ chambers.
{31}{pn-s-u: God } spoke the word, and there came clouds of flies, ⁕
   swarms of gnats within all their borders.
{32}{pn-s-u: God } gave them hailstones for rain ⁕
   and flames of lightning in their land.
{33}{pn-s-u: God } blasted their vines and their fig trees ⁕
   and shattered trees across their country.
{34}{pn-s-u: God } spoke the word, and the grasshoppers came ⁕
   and young locusts without number;
{35}They ate every plant in their land ⁕
   and devoured the fruit of their soil.
{36}{pn-s-u: God } smote all the firstborn in their land, ⁕
   the first fruits of all their strength. 
{37}Then {pn-s-l: God } brought them out with silver and gold; ⁕
   there was not one among their tribes that stumbled.
{38}Egypt was glad at their departing, ⁕
   for a dread of them had fallen upon them.
{39}{pn-s-u: God } spread out a cloud for a covering ⁕
   and a fire to light up the night.
{40}They asked and {pn-s-l: God } brought them quails; ⁕
   {pn-s-l: God } satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
{41}{pn-s-u: God } opened the rock, and the waters gushed out ⁕
   and ran in the dry places like a river.

   and Abraham, {pn-p-l: God’s } servant.
{43}So {pn-s-l: God } brought forth {pn-p-l: God’s } people with joy, ⁕
   {pn-p-l: God’s } chosen ones with singing.
{44}{pn-s-u: God } gave them the lands of the nations ⁕

{1}Alleluia. \
     Give thanks to {def-l: God }, for {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-is: is } gracious, ⁕
   for {pn-p-l: God’s } faithfulness endures for ever.
{2}Who can express the mighty acts of {def-l: God } ⁕
   or show forth all {pn-p-l: God’s } praise?
{3}Blessed are those who observe what is right ⁕
   and always do what is just.
{4}Remember me, O {voc: God }, in the favour you bear for your people; ⁕
   visit me in the day of your salvation;
{5}That I may see the prosperity of your chosen \
     and rejoice in the gladness of your people, ⁕
   and exult with your inheritance. 
{6}We have sinned like our forebears; ⁕
   we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.
{7}In Egypt they did not consider your wonders, \
     nor remember the abundance of your faithful love; ⁕
   they rebelled against the Most High at the Red Sea.
{8}But {pn-s-l: God } saved them for {pn-p-l: God’s } name’s sake, ⁕
   that {pn-s-l: God } might make known {pn-p-l: God’s } power.
{9}{pn-s-u: God } rebuked the Red Sea and it was dried up; ⁕
   so {pn-s-l: God } led them through the deep as through the wilderness.
{10}{pn-s-u: God } saved them from the adversary’s hand ⁕
   and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
{11}As for those that troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them; ⁕
   there was not one of them left.
{12}Then they believed {pn-p-l: God’s } words ⁕
   and sang aloud {pn-p-l: God’s } praise. 
{13}But soon they forgot {pn-p-l: God’s } deeds ⁕
   and would not wait for {pn-p-l: God’s } counsel.
{14}A craving seized them in the wilderness, ⁕
   and they put God to the test in the desert.
{15}{pn-s-u: God } gave them their desire, ⁕
   but sent a wasting sickness among them.
{16}They grew jealous of Moses in the camp ⁕
   and of Aaron, the holy one of {def-l: God }.
{17}So the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan ⁕
   and covered the company of Abiram.
{18}A fire was kindled in their company; ⁕
   the flame burnt up the wicked. 
{19}They made a calf at Horeb ⁕
   and worshipped the molten image;
{20}Thus they exchanged their glory ⁕
   for the image of an ox that feeds on hay.
{21}They forgot God their saviour, ⁕
   who had done such great things in Egypt,
{22}Wonderful deeds in the land of Ham ⁕
   and fearful things at the Red Sea.
{23}So {pn-s-l: God } would have destroyed them, \
     had not Moses {pn-p-l: God’s } chosen stood before {pn-o-l: God } in the breach, ⁕
   to turn away {pn-p-l: God’s } wrath from consuming them.  
{24}Then they scorned the Promised Land ⁕
   and would not believe {pn-p-l: God’s } word,
{25}But murmured in their tents ⁕
   and would not heed the voice of {def-l: God }.
{26}So {pn-s-l: God } lifted a hand against them ⁕
   and swore to overthrow them in the wilderness,
{27}To disperse their descendants among the nations, ⁕
   and to scatter them throughout the lands. 
{28}They joined themselves to the Baal of Peor ⁕
   and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
{29}They provoked {pn-o-l: God } to anger with their evil deeds ⁕
   and a plague broke out among them.
{30}Then Phinehas stood up and interceded ⁕
   and so the plague was stayed.
{31}This was counted to him for righteousness ⁕
   throughout all generations for ever.
{32}They angered {pn-o-l: God } also at the waters of Meribah, ⁕
   so that Moses suffered for their sake;
{33}For they so embittered {pn-p-l: God’s } spirit ⁕
   that rash words were spoken with {pn-p-l: God’s } lips. 
{34}They did not destroy the peoples ⁕
   as {def-l: God } had commanded them.
{35}They mingled with the nations ⁕
   and learned to follow their ways,
{36}So that they worshipped their idols, ⁕
   which became to them a snare.
{37}Their own children ⁕
   they sacrificed to evil spirits.
{38}They shed innocent blood, ⁕
   the blood of their children,
{39}Which they offered to the idols of Canaan, ⁕
   and the land was defiled with blood.
{40}Thus were they polluted by their actions, ⁕
   and in their wanton deeds went whoring after other gods. 
{41}Therefore was the wrath of {def-l: God } \
     kindled against {pn-p-l: God’s } people, ⁕
   and {pn-s-l: God } abhorred {pn-p-l: God’s } inheritance.
{42}{pn-s-u: God } gave them over to the hand of the nations, ⁕
   and those who hated them ruled over them.
{43}So their enemies oppressed them ⁕
   and put them in subjection under their hand.
{44}Many a time did {pn-s-l: God } deliver them, \
     but they rebelled through their own devices ⁕
   and were brought down through their wickedness.
{45}Nevertheless, {pn-s-l: God } saw their adversity, ⁕
   when {pn-s-l: God } heard their lamentation.
{46}{pn-s-u: God } remembered the covenant with them ⁕
   and relented according to the greatness of {pn-p-l: God’s } faithful love.
{47}{pn-s-u: God } made them also to be pitied ⁕
   by all who had taken them captive. 
{48}Save us, O {voc: God } our God, \
     and gather us from among the nations, ⁕
   that we may give thanks to your holy name \
     and glory in your praise.
{49}Blessed be {def-l: God }, the God of Israel, \
     from everlasting and to everlasting; ⁕
   and let all the people say, Amen. \

   those {pn-s-l: God } redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
{3}And gathered out of the lands from the east and from the west, ⁕
   from the north and from the south.
{4}Some went astray in desert wastes ⁕
   and found no path to a city to dwell in.
{5}Hungry and thirsty, ⁕
   their soul was fainting within them.
{6}So they cried to {def-l: God } in their trouble ⁕
   and {pn-s-l: God } delivered them from their distress.
{7}{pn-s-u: God } set their feet on the right way ⁕
   till they came to a city to dwell in.

{10}Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, ⁕
   bound fast in misery and iron,
{11}For they had rebelled against the words of God ⁕
   and despised the counsel of the Most High.
{12}So {pn-s-l: God } bowed down their heart with heaviness; ⁕
   they stumbled and there was none to help them.
{13}Then they cried to {def-l: God } in their trouble, ⁕
   and {pn-s-l: God } delivered them from their distress.
{14}{pn-s-u: God } brought them out of darkness and out of the shadow of death, ⁕

{17}Some were foolish and took a rebellious way, ⁕
   and were plagued because of their wrongdoing.

{25}For at his word the stormy wind arose ⁕
   and lifted up the waves of the sea.
{26}They were carried up to the heavens \
     and down again to the deep; ⁕
   their soul melted away in their peril.
{27}They reeled and staggered like a drunkard ⁕

{32}Let them exalt {pn-o-l: God } in the congregation of the people ⁕
   and praise {pn-o-l: God } in the council of the elders.
{33}{def-u: God } turns rivers into wilderness ⁕
   and water springs into thirsty ground;
{34}A fruitful land {pn-s-l: God } {pn-v-s: makes } a salty waste, ⁕
   because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
{35}{pn-s-u: God } {pn-v-s: makes } the wilderness a pool of water ⁕
   and water springs out of a thirsty land.

{1}Keep silent no longer, O God of my praise, ⁕
   for the mouth of wickedness and treachery is opened against me.

   they encompassed me with words of hatred \
     and fought against me without a cause.
{3}In return for my love, they set themselves against me, ⁕
   even though I had prayed for them.
{4}Thus have they repaid me with evil for good, ⁕
   and hatred for my good will.
{5}They say, ‘Appoint a wicked person over them, ⁕

{6}‘When they are judged, let them be found guilty, ⁕

{17}‘They clothed themself with cursing as with a garment: ⁕
   it seeped into their body like water \

   and like the belt that they wear continually.’
{19}Thus may {def-l: God } repay my accusers ⁕
   and those who speak evil against me. 
{20}But deal with me, O {voc: God } my God, according to your name; ⁕
   O deliver me, for sweet is your faithfulness.
{21}For I am helpless and poor ⁕
   and my heart is disquieted within me.
{22}I fade like a shadow that lengthens; ⁕
   I am shaken off like a locust.

{2}As for our lyres, we hung them up ⁕
   on the willows that grow in that land.
{3}For there our captors asked for a song, \
     our tormentors called for mirth: ⁕
   ‘Sing us one of the songs of Zion.’ 
{4}How shall we sing {def-l: God }’s song ⁕
   in a strange land?
{5}If I forget you, O Jerusalem, ⁕
   let my right hand forget its skill.
{6}Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, ⁕
   if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy. 
{7}Remember, O {voc: God }, against the people of Edom \
     the day of Jerusalem, ⁕
   how they said, ‘Down with it, down with it, \
     even to the ground.’
{8}O children of Babylon, doomed to destruction, ⁕
   happy the one who repays you for all you have done to us;
{9}Who takes your little ones, ⁕
   and dashes them against the rock.

{2}I will bow down towards your holy temple and praise your name, \
     because of your love and faithfulness; ⁕
   for you have glorified your name \
     and your word above all things.
{3}In the day that I called to you, you answered me; ⁕
   you put new strength in my soul. 
{4}All the rulers of the earth shall praise you, O {voc: God }, ⁕
   for they have heard the words of your mouth.
{5}They shall sing of the ways of {def-l: God }, ⁕
   that great is the glory of {def-l: God }.

# Psalm 139

### {Refrain} Search me out, O God, and know my heart.

{1}O {voc: God }, you have searched me out and known me; ⁕
   you know my sitting down and my rising up; \
     you discern my thoughts from afar.
{2}You mark out my journeys and my resting place ⁕
   and are acquainted with all my ways.
{3}For there is not a word on my tongue, ⁕
   but you, O {voc: God }, know it altogether.
{4}You encompass me behind and before ⁕
   and lay your hand upon me.
{5}Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, ⁕
   so high that I cannot attain it. 
{6}Where can I go then from your spirit? ⁕
   Or where can I flee from your presence?
{7}If I climb up to heaven, you are there; ⁕
   if I make the grave my bed, you are there also.
{8}If I take the wings of the morning ⁕
   and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
{9}Even there your hand shall lead me, ⁕
   your right hand hold me fast.
{10}If I say, ‘Surely the darkness will cover me ⁕
   and the light around me turn to night,’
{11}Even darkness is no darkness with you; \
     the night is as clear as the day; ⁕
   darkness and light to you are both alike. 
{12}For you yourself created my inmost parts; ⁕
   you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
{13}I thank you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; ⁕
   marvellous are your works, my soul knows well.
{14}My frame was not hidden from you, ⁕
   when I was made in secret \
     and woven in the depths of the earth.
{15}Your eyes beheld my form, as yet unfinished; ⁕
   already in your book were all my members written,
{16}As day by day they were fashioned ⁕
   when as yet there was none of them.
{17}How deep are your counsels to me, O God! ⁕
   How great is the sum of them!
{18}If I count them, they are more in number than the sand, ⁕
   and at the end, I am still in your presence. 
{19}O that you would slay the wicked, O God, ⁕
   that the bloodthirsty might depart from me!
{20}They speak against you with wicked intent; ⁕
   your enemies take up your name for evil.
{21}Do I not oppose those, O {voc: God }, who oppose you? ⁕
   Do I not abhor those who rise up against you?
{22}I hate them with a perfect hatred; ⁕
   they have become my own enemies also.
{23}Search me out, O God, and know my heart; ⁕
   try me and examine my thoughts.
{24}See if there is any way of wickedness in me ⁕
   and lead me in the way everlasting.

# Psalm 140

### {Refrain} Keep me, O {voc: God }, from the hands of the wicked.

   and stir up strife all the day long.
{3}They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; ⁕
   adder’s poison is under their lips.
{4}Keep me, O {voc: God }, from the hands of the wicked; ⁕
   protect me from the violent who seek to make me stumble.
{5}The proud have laid a snare for me \
     and spread out a net of cords; ⁕
   they have set traps along my path. 
{6}I have said to {def-l: God }, ‘You are my God; ⁕
   listen, O {voc: God }, to the voice of my supplication.
{7}‘O {voc: God } God, the strength of my salvation, ⁕
   you have covered my head in the day of battle.
{8}‘Do not grant the desires of the wicked, O {voc: God }, ⁕
   do not prosper their wicked plans. 
{9}‘Let not those who surround me lift up their heads; ⁕
   let the evil of their own lips fall upon them.
{10}‘Let hot burning coals rain upon them; ⁕
   let them be cast into the depths, that they rise not again.’
{11}No slanderer shall prosper on the earth, ⁕
   and evil shall hunt down the violent to overthrow them. 
{12}I know that {def-l: God } will bring justice for the oppressed ⁕
   and maintain the cause of the needy.
{13}Surely, the righteous will give thanks to your name, ⁕
   and the upright shall dwell in your presence.

# Psalm 141

### {Refrain} Set a watch before my mouth, O {voc: God }.

{1}O {voc: God }, I call to you; come to me quickly; ⁕
   hear my voice when I cry to you.
{2}Let my prayer rise before you as incense, ⁕
   the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
{3}Set a watch before my mouth, O {voc: God }, ⁕
   and guard the door of my lips;
{4}Let not my heart incline to any evil thing; ⁕
   let me not be occupied in wickedness with evildoers, \
     nor taste the pleasures of their table. 
{5}Let the righteous smite me in friendly rebuke; \
     but let not the oil of the unrighteous anoint my head; ⁕
   for my prayer is continually against their wicked deeds.
{6}Let their rulers be overthrown in stony places; ⁕
   then they may know that my words are sweet.
{7}As when a plough turns over the earth in furrows, ⁕
   let their bones be scattered at the mouth of the Pit. 
{8}But my eyes are turned to you, {voc: God } God; ⁕
   in you I take refuge; do not leave me defenceless.
{9}Protect me from the snare which they have laid for me ⁕
   and from the traps of the evildoers.
{10}Let the wicked fall into their own nets, ⁕
   while I pass by in safety.

### {Refrain} Bring my soul out of prison, \

   to {def-l: God } I make my supplication.
{2}I pour out my complaint before {pn-o-l: God } ⁕
   and tell {pn-o-l: God } of my trouble.
{3}When my spirit faints within me, you know my path; ⁕
   in the way wherein I walk have they laid a snare for me.
{4}I look to my right hand, and find no one who knows me; ⁕
   I have no place to flee to, and no one cares for my soul. 
{5}I cry out to you, O {voc: God }, and say: ⁕
   ‘You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
{6}‘Listen to my cry, for I am brought very low; ⁕
   save me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me.

     and in your faithfulness give ear to my supplications; ⁕
   answer me in your righteousness.
{2}Enter not into judgement with your servant, ⁕
   for in your sight shall no one living be justified.
{3}For the enemy has pursued me, \
     crushing my life to the ground, ⁕
   making me sit in darkness like those long dead.
{4}My spirit faints within me; ⁕
   my heart within me is desolate. 
{5}I remember the time past; I muse upon all your deeds; ⁕
   I consider the works of your hands.
{6}I stretch out my hands to you; ⁕
   my soul gasps for you like a thirsty land.
{7}O {voc: God }, make haste to answer me; my spirit fails me; ⁕
   hide not your face from me \
     lest I be like those who go down to the Pit.
{8}Let me hear of your loving-kindness in the morning, \

   let your kindly spirit lead me on a level path.
